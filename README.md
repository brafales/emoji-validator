We all love emojis, but sometimes unfortunately we can't handle them. Use these two validators to seamlessly ensure they don't end up messing up with your models.

Supports ActiveModel > 4

Tested against Ruby 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.5.1

Depends on the [unicode-emoji](https://rubygems.org/gems/unicode-emoji) gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'emoji-validator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install emoji-validator

## Usage

Two validators are provided in the gem:

### Disallow emojis on all attributes for your model
Use the `NoEmojiAnywhereValidator` to make all attributes of your ActiveRecord class automatically validate against emojis:
```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Emoji::Validator::NoEmojiAnywhereValidator
end

person = Person.new(first_name: "ðŸ˜ƒ", last_name: "ðŸ˜ƒ")
person.valid? #false
person.errors.count #2
```

### Disallow emojis on single attributes for your model
Use the `NoEmojiValidator` to make single attributes of your ActiveRecord class validate against emojis:
```ruby
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :first_name, no_emoji: true
end

person = Person.new(first_name: "John", last_name: "ðŸ˜ƒ")
person.valid? #true
person.first_name = "ðŸ˜ƒ"
person.valid? #false
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
